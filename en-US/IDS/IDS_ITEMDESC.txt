Many cards in this Deck, such as "<card mrk = '13943'/>", rely on certain cards being in the Graveyard. When sending your cards to the Graveyard with cards like "<card mrk = '18196'/>", the trick is to choose cards that have effects that can be activated from the Graveyard, such as "<card mrk = '18437'/>". When you are ready, Xyz Summon "<card mrk = '11069'/>". If it doesn't have "<card mrk = '9729'/>" attached as Xyz Material, the damage it deals will be halved, but it still has high ATK! Further increase its ATK with its effect to deal a devastating blow and emerge as the victor.
[IDS_ITEMDESC.ID1120027]
This is a daringly offensive "<category id='30'/>" Deck that relies on Fusion Summoning.
Your first goal should be to bring out "<card mrk = '9229'/>", which can be achieved in various ways, such as by using the effect of "<card mrk = '9190'/>" to Special Summon "<card mrk = '9063'/>". With the effects of "<card mrk = '9229'/>", you can both prepare your Graveyard as well as add "<card mrk = '4837'/>" to your hand. This makes it easy to Fusion Summon "<category id='30'/>" monsters. "<card mrk = '17471'/>" goes a long way when you need to prepare for your opponent's turn, so add it to your hand with the effect of "<card mrk = '18663'/>". The ideal monster to Special Summon with it is "<card mrk = '17443'/>", since it not only lets you destroy several of your opponent's cards, but also gives you a high-ATK powerhouse to go on the offensive with!
[IDS_ITEMDESC.ID1120028]
This "<category id='31'/>" Deck focuses on Special Summoning through "<card mrk = '15245'/>".
You can Fusion Summon using monsters from the Deck using "<card mrk = '17066'/>", an extremely powerful and strategically vital card. Find a way to get it ready as soon as possible, such as by using the effect of "<card mrk = '16195'/>". Once set up, perform successive Fusion Summons - first "<card mrk = '17070'/>", and then the Deck's ace monster, "<card mrk = '17069'/>", which has two effects: a monster-banishing effect activatable during either player's turn, and a fail-safe effect that activates if it leaves the field because of an opponent's card, letting you destroy all of your opponent's monsters in the End Phase!
[IDS_ITEMDESC.ID1120029]
This "<category id='55'/>" Deck achieves supremacy through blistering power.
Starting with a card like "<card mrk='19014'/>", perform a series of Synchro Summons - first "<card mrk='12695'/>", and then "<card mrk='19021'/>". You can not only Synchro Summon a powerhouse Synchro Monster, but also use the effect of "<card mrk='19021'/>" to bring forth "<card mrk='7735'/>". Use these Synchro Monsters' incredibly high ATK to blaze to victory!
[IDS_ITEMDESC.ID1120030]
This "<category id='106'/>" Deck symbolizes the power of monsters united.
Start your offense with Level 4 monsters such as "<card mrk='19460'/>", which can pave the way for "<card mrk='15519'/>", "<card mrk='19501'/>", and "<card mrk='12868'/>". Use their effects to Summon "<card mrk='19459'/>" and amass a fearsome band of "<category id='106'/>" monsters. Then, use "<card mrk='12868'/>" with Xyz Material to Link Summon "<card mrk='14205'/>" and bring forth powerful Xyz Monsters while continuing to Summon other monsters. When everything is in place, use cards like "<card mrk='19511'/>" on your opponent's turn to call upon "<card mrk='19500'/>". This card will bring you instantly closer to victory by obliterating the cards on your opponent's field and dealing direct damage to them, all while being unaffected to other card effects!
